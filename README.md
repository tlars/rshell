Known Bugs
the conncetors do not work

if you were to use the comment after a connector, then that won't work because the connectors arent up

can work with multiple semicolons after a command
anything to do with the || and && will not run properly


What works

the exit command works
only the semicolon connector work

single line commands and comments work

since the last homework assignment I have fixed the connector issue and the all three connectors are working
I was able to fix some of the exit errors, but there are a few times when i had to type exit more than once
to exit the program.

For the homework 2 problems I have the test command up and running alongside with the conncetors
However I do not have the () working yet with the connctors.
There are some cases where it works and others where it gives me something else or seg faults
