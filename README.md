Known Bugs
the conncetors do not work

if you were to use the comment after a connector, then that won't work because the connectors arent up

can work with multiple semicolons after a command
anything to do with the || and && will not run properly


What works

the exit command works
only the semicolon connector work
single line commands and comments work
